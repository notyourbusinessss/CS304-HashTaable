# Making a HashTable
## What is a hashTable
A Hash Table is a DataStructure that makes the retriving and finding of a certain point, O(1). This is done by Creating a relational link between the objects and their position in the Hashtable's array. For example a fairely easy HashTable to implement would be one for storing numbers.\
HashTable's Array :\
```
|   null   |   null   |   null   |   null   |   null   |   null   |   null   |
```
Initially of course there is no value, but if we were to add, for exampl, 2 it would get placed at position 2.
```
|   null   |   null   |   2   |   null   |   null   |   null   |   null   |
```
